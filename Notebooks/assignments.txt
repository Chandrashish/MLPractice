Assignment 1:

Build a spam filter

- train 3 classifiers of your choice on sms spam data
- for each classifier show precision and recall
- explain briefly how the classifier works

Assignment 2:

k-means clustering

- choose a dataset other than the mnist
- apply k-means clustering and evaluate the results
- visualize the data using t-sne

Assignment 3:

linear regression

- Reproduce the results from Chapter 3 from ISLR on Adverstising data
to answer which channels can be attributed to sales

Assignment 4:

recommender systems

movielens data
- choose and implement a similarity scoring between two users (e.g. pearson)
- write to function that takes user as input and outputs top 10 movies recommened to him which he has not seen

Assignment 5:

backpropagation algorithm

- write a function to train a logistic regression using SGD
- write a function to train a depth 3 neural network using backpropagation algorithm

Assignment 6:

transfer learning

- use a pretrained neural network to train "cats" vs "dogs" classification
on 100 images of cats and 100 images of dogs

you may choose other classification instead of "cats" vs "dogs"
